# Challenge 2 - Count the Blocks

_Difficulty: 30 david-minutes_

## Before you start

- Create a new project with Create-React-App
- Install styled-component( optional )

## Basic requirements

- Create a UI that looks like this:  
![](images/c2/1.png)
- When the 'Red' button is pressed, a nother red block should appear and the counter below the row of red blocks should increment.
- When the user clicks on one of the red blocks then the clicked red block should be removed and the counter below should decrement

## Advanced requirements

- Improve the UI to look like this:  
![](images/c2/2.png)
- Clicking on the 'Red' button should add a new red block to the row of blocks, and the 'Red blocks' counter should increment
- The 'Red' button should be disabled when there are 10 red blocks present
- Clicking on the 'Blue' button should add a new blue block to the row of blocks, and the 'Blue blocks' couter should increment
- The 'Blue' button should be disabled when there are 10 blue blocks present
- Clicking on any of the blocks should remove it, and the associated counter should decrement
- When there are 10 red blocks and 10 blue blocks, both 'Red' and 'Blue' button becomes disabled, and clicking on blocks to remove them also become disabled
- A 'You Win 'message appears at the bottom of the page along with a 'reset' button
- Clicking on the reset button will remove all the blocks, and the 'You Win' message, and the user will be able to add blocks by clicking the 'Red' and 'Blue' buttons again
